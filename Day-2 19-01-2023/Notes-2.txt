Monolith Architecture vs MicroService Architecture vs FAAS]]

Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a serverless way to execute modular pieces of code on the edge. 
FaaS lets developers write and update a piece of code on the fly, which can then be executed in response to an event, such as a user clicking on an element in a web application. 
This makes it easy to scale code and is a cost-efficient way to implement microservices.
